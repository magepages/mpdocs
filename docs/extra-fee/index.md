## 9. How to custom using the layout handle

- To display Extra Fee in Magento's default email, you need to visit `Marketing > Communications > Email Templates`. You can create a new template for order, invoice, shipment, credit memo, etc. Use different code for each template to display Extra Fee data (do the same for PDF Invoice templates). Note: If there is extra fee data, this data will be displayed and vice versa, if there is no data, this template will be the same as normal Magento template.
  - **Order, Shipment**
    - Get Extra Fee information at Payment Method.
```    
{{if order.getHasBillingExtraFee()}}
{{layout handle="mp_billing_extra_fee" order_id=$order_id area="frontend"}}
{{/if}}

```

   - Get Extra Fee information at Shipping Method.
   
```
{{if order.getHasBillingExtraFee()}}
{{layout handle="mp_billing_extra_fee" order_id=$order_id area="frontend"}}
{{/if}}

  - Get Extra Fee information at Cart Summary. Note: The rules with `Apply Type = Automatic` will also appear in Cart Summary in the backend and display on the template.

```
{{if order.getHasExtraFee()}}
<h3>{{trans "Extra Fee"}}</h3>
{{layout handle="mp_extra_fee" order_id=$order_id area="frontend"}}
{{/if}}

```

  - **Invoice**
    - Get Extra Fee information at Payment Method:

{{/if}}

```

  - Get Extra Fee information at Shipping Method

{{/if}}

```

  - **Credit Memo**:

{{layout handle="mp_billing_extra_fee" order_id=$order_id area="frontend" creditmemo_id=$creditmemo_id}}
{{/if}}

```

  - Get Extra Fee informaiton at Shipping Method
