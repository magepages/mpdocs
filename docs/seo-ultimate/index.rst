1.8.1. Hreflang Tag
########################

The Hreflang tag is the necessary tag if your website must approach multi-countries. The hreflang attribute tells Google which language you are using on a specific page, so the search engine can serve that result to users searching in that language.

In order to use the hreflang tag, you need to do:

* Enable the hreflang URL when selecting "Yes"
* Allow you to apply the hreflang for the product, category, and pages if you need.
* Assign **X-default** to the specific store view that means if the visitors come from another country with the language you don't support, the assigned store view to X-default will be displayed in this situation.
