Making a quick order has never been easy for any customer, especially for wholesale customers. To solve this problem, Magento experts from Mageplaza have released Magento 2 Quick Order extension. Thanks to this extension, customers can order quickly by searching for the product name or SKU of that product. Ordering process becomes easier than ever for your customers.

Quick Order extension can be used by both the Customer who has an account at the store and the Guest who has no account. We believe that with the help of this module, you can improve the revenues and profits dramatically.

* 1 - **Add to cart button**:

  * This button allows customers to add all products that they have selected in the virtual cart (in area 4) into the real cart of the store in order to checkout.
  * If there's an error in this process, the system will take the page back the Quick Order page and all products in the virtual cart won't be lost.
  
* 2 - **Checkout button**: Similar to 1 - Add to cart button, the only difference is, instead of going to Shopping Cart Page, customers will be redirected to the Checkout page.

* 3 - **Instant Search Box**:
  * Customers can look for the product that they want to purchase by SKU or the product name when filling in this box.
  * The result will show the information and the images of the product that can adapt to the conditions customers enter.
  * The number of the result will be controlled in the configuration by the admin.
  * When admins change Currency or other information of the products, maybe 'Search' will make the information display incorrect. Therefore, admins need to access `pub/media/mageplaza`, remove Search item and Refresh the Quick Order page to update the information for the system. You need to runthe command `php bin/magento index:rein` after creating a new product.

  
* 4 - **The virtual cart**:
  * This the place where can store temporarily the products customers want to purchase.
  * At this field, customers can see all information of products, change options of the attribute, modify the quantity or add a new product as well as delete those products from the virtual cart.
  * The price displaying in the virtual cart is the original price of each product, not count Tax.
  
* 5 - **Add to cart button**: Similar to 1 - Add to cart button
* 6 - **Checkout button**: Similar to 2 - Checkout button
* 7 - **Add multiple products by SKU box**:
  * When customers have known SKU and the attributes of the products, it's so easy for them to add these products to the virtual cart by SKU box.
  * Customers only need to fill the information of products as the following format: SKU, qty, size:M, color: Black
  * Customers need to line up to add other products.
  * Finally, customers click on 9 - Add to list to add products to the virtual cart.
  * For example: MH02, 9, size:M, color:Red

* 8 - **Add multiple products by CSV file and XML file**:
  * Customers need to download sample CSV file or XML file at first import by CSV or XML to know the format in the CSV file or XML file.
  * With the eligible CSV file or XML file, all products listed in that will be added into the virtual cart after clicking `Upload Now`
  
* 9 - **Add to list button**: 
  * After customers enter the information into SKU box or upload the CSV file, they need to click on this button to add them into the virtual cart.
  * This button only works if the SKU box has the information.
