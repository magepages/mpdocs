# Better Product Reviews 

## Overview

Customers are more likely to make purchasing decisions when they see a product that has good reviews from other customers. Mageplaza Better Product Reviews extension helps new customers to quickly capture the number of reviews, average number of stars, recommend percentage, rating star chart at the top of the review block of each Product Detail Page. In addition, customers can also write reviews for products purchased quickly when entering `My Account> My Product Reviews`. Another great function of the module is that admin can not only browse or approve reviews, but also can reply customer reviews. Review apply will be displayed right below that review without drifting away. Thereby bringing a great experience to customers, increasing attraction, and increasing revenue for store owners
