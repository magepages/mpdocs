# Configurable Products Preselect

## Overview

When customers access a page of any configurable product, it is hard for them to review and choose the attributes if no options are available. [Configurable Products Preselect of Mageplaza](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-configurable-products-preselect/) supports displaying certain combinations of a Configurable product, helping to orient and save time for customers. With this extension, you can set the selections you like and display them by default at the **Product View Detail Page**. This extension also supports 4 types of Preselect: **The First Option of Each Attribute Option, Default Product, The Cheapest Product and The Most Expensive Product**. It is fully compatible with [Mageplaza Quick View & AJAX Cart](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-quick-view/), [Mageplaza Seo](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-seo-extension/) and [Layered Navigation](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-layered-navigation-extension/seo-friendly-url.html).
