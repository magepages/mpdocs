### 1. Email logs

This can be accessed by the following  `Stores > SMTP > Emails Log`. From here you can look back all the sent email from the server to customers.

At here, you can view all information as *ID, Subject, From, To, Bcc, Status, Created At* as well as allow admins to take some actions for emails that are sent from the server to customers. At the same time, you also delete all emails by clicking on the **Clear** button.

Some actions can be taken:

* **View**: To review the content of the email that is saved in the Emails Log. Admin can review by clicking `Select > View` in the `Action` column.

Below is the content of an email after you click on the **View** button

* **Resend**:

  * In the `Action` column, choose `Select > Resend`. This means that the selected email will be resent once and that Email Resend is also logged, which enables admins to know if the Email Resend is sent successfully or failed.
  * The `Resend` feature can work well even if you disable the module. The Resend Email will apply the Provider of SMTP, however, it won’t be logged in the Emails Log.
  * To resend lots of emails at once, you only need to tick, then choose `Action` at the upper left of the Grid, and select `Resend`.

### 2. Configuration

#### 2.2.1 General Configuration

Be sure you’re at Admin Panel, for general configuration `Stores > Settings > Configuration > Mageplaza > SMTP`. Choose **General Configuration** sections.

![](https://i.imgur.com/AOiIER7.png)

* In the **Enable Mageplaza SMTP** field, select “Yes” to enable Mageplaza SMTP extension.
* **Log Email** provides two modes:
  * Yes: Sent emails will be saved in the Emails Log, you can preview it and have it clean up to follow the fixed schedule.
  * No: Sent emails won’t be archived.
* **Clean Email Log Every**: This field limits the storage time for the email you sent. After that limited number of days, Email will be auto-deleted. If you do not want to delete the emails, leave the field blank.

* **Blacklist**: Enter the regular expression (regex) for email patern in this field, meaning that emails with the same pattern as the patern here will not receive any mail from the system.
  * Regex is written between two right slashes /../. Basic regex:
    * `[0-9]`: digits from 0 to 9
    * `[a-z]`: lowercase letters from a to z
    * `[A-Z]`: uppercase letters from A to Z
    * `abc`: letter. For example: `/abc/` correspond to "abc" string in the defaut pattern string “abcdefgh”
    * `123`: number. For example: `/123/` correspond to "123" string in the defaut pattern string “abc123”
    * `\d`: any number from 0 to 9
    * `\w`: a letter
    * `\s`: white space (space, tab, new line, ...)
    * `\D`: non-numeric character
    * `\W`: non-letter characters
    * `\S`: character not white space
    * `.` : any character except the new line. For example: `.{3}` will correspond to any string with 3 characters
    * `+` : indecates the element appears >= 1 time
    * `*` : indicates that the element appears >= 0 times (may not appear)
    * `?` : indicates the element appears 0 or 1 time
    * `^` : represents the first element of the string. For example: `^a` corresponds to the letter "a" in the string "abc"
    * `$` : matches the last character of the string. For example, `c$` matches the character "c" in the string "abc"
    * `?` : matches 0 or 1 times the character preceding it. For example: `a?` will be able to match "abc" or "bc" in the target string "abcdbc"
    * `a|b` : corresponds to a or b.
    * `{x}` : corresponds to x times. For example: `{3}` corresponds to 3 characters
    * `{x,}` : at least x times. For example, `{2,}` corresponds to at least 2 characters
    * `{x,y}` : from x to y times. For example, `{2,6}` corresponds to 2 to 6 characters
    * To use special characters, use the `\` before that character. For example: `/\.\+\*/` corresponds to. `.+*`

For example, the pattern of an email is: `/^[0-9][a-z0-9\$\%\&]+@[a-z]+\.[a-z]{2,}$/`

* `^[0-9]` : start with a number between 0 and 9
* `[a-z0-9\$\%\&]` : the rest of the email may contain multiple digits, letters, characters $, %, &
* `@` : ending email address with the @ character
* `[a-z]+` : domain names include lowercase characters
* `\.[a-z]{2,}$` : End with top-level domain: begins with dot, followed by only lowercase characters, and requires at least 2 characters, `$` sign indicates end of string.
