- **Image Quality**: select the image optimization level, including 2 types:
  - **Custom**: a filter which help to remove some data. Noted that this will reduce the image quality so you should be careful with the level of image quality reduction as the image can be blurry and unclear. 
Choosing **Custom** will show more fields:
    - **Quality Percent**: Enter the percent in the **Quality percent** field which will be limited between 1 and 100. For good image quality, please maintain quality above 90. If left blank, default value is 92.
- **Lossless**: is a data compression filter. This does not reduce image quality but it will require uncompressed images before they can be rendered.
- **Create Webp Image File When Optimizing**: if you select **Yes**, when being optimized, image files will be transfered to Webp format. It helps reduce the image size for your server without decreasing the image quality. Field shown:
