# Reports Ultimate

Previously, Mageplaza has released Standard and Professional Reports module that helps shop owners statistically and more easily manage the number of customers, the number of transactions, or the revenue earned in a day/year/etc. In order to meet the higher demands of the store manager, we have upgraded this module to the [Ultimate Report version](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-reports-extension/) to help shop owners have super helpful reports such as Sales by Category, Sales by Attribute Set, Sales by Payment, Sales by Coupon Code and so on. 

## How to configure

Login to the Magento admin panel, choose `Store > Settings > Configuration > Mageplaza Extensions > Reports`
