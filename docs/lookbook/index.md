# Lookbook

## Introduce 
Lookbooks are an effective tool in assisting online stores to attract and engage with customers as well as boost sales revenue. For Magento stores, the Lookbook extension will enable you to create multiple gallery collections that educate and recommend customers about the ways to mix and match products together. You can attach the product links to their positions on the images and the links will lead customers to the individual product pages. Also, you are able to place the lookbooks anywhere on the website as your wish.
