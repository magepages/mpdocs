How to configure LinkedIn API
=================================

LinkedIn requires that you create an external application linking your website to their API. **Application** id and secret (also sometimes referred as **Consumer** key and secret or **Client** id and secret) are what we call an application credentials. This application will link your website example.com to LinkedIn API and these credentials are needed in order for LinkedIn users to access your website.

These credentials may also differ in format, name and content depending on the social network.
