# Mass Order Actions


## Overview

Currently, when having to process orders at the management page, the shop owner must go to each order to be able to create invoices, shipping methods, email notifications to customers in each order. From now on, with Mageplaza Mass Order Actions extension, admins can create more features at the order grid page to manage and handle multiple orders at the same time. In addition, we support Mass Order Actions compatible with some extensions such as [Delete Orders](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-delete-orders/), [PDF Invoice](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-pdf-invoice-extension/), [SMTP](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-smtp/), [Order Archive](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-order-archive/) to reduce workload for your sites. This extension helps you quickly process orders and dramatically improve your order management.
