# Gift card

## Overview 

Gift card, also known as gift certificate or gift voucher, is a prepaid stored-value money card usually used in depositing money on a store online’s account of customers. Gift cards are issued as an alternative to cash or credit cards to purchase products within a particular store. The amount of deposited money in the gift card is granted indefinitely and they can not transfer from one account to another or purchase another gift card.

The extension offers magnificent features that allow admins to create unlimited virtual/physical gift cards with a full control over templates; the price of the gift card and the value of purchases; gift codes and discounts; conditions of use; expiration and display locations. Moreover, it's really flexible for gift card users to create their own card templates, track and manage their sent gift certificates. In addition, buyers can take advantage of the basic and advanced features of gift cards.

Furthermore, Gift Card extension allows store owners can send to their customer via emails, SMS or Post Office.

### IX. How to import Gift Card Code(s)

At the admin backend, keep track ``System > Data Transfer: Import``
![](https://i.imgur.com/NLPKIXl.png)

At the Import page, choose the extension you need to input Gift Code(s). At **Import Settings**, choose ``Entity Types = Mageplaza Gift Card Code``, **Import Behaviour** and **File to Import** will be displayed.
![](https://i.imgur.com/rlGZphI.png)

To have a CSV file containing basic information to import Gift Card Code(s), you need to click ``Download Sample File``. Then edit the content in available columns in the Sample File to have a CSV file which has Gift Card Code(s) easily and quickly. A quick note that you shouldn’t change the name of columns, otherwise it will get an error message when Check Data lauches.
![](https://i.imgur.com/TQlwiFO.png)

A CSV file contains:
* **Code**: This is the column to fill Gift Card Code(s). The admin can enter any code as his wish. This is a required information.
* **Balance**: This is where you can enter the corresponding balance of each gift card. This is a required information.
* **Status**: indicates the status of a gift card. This is a required information. There are 6 statuses:
  * 1: means **Active** status
  * 2: means **Inactive** status
  * 3: means **Pending** status
  * 4:  means **Used** status
  * 5:  means **Expired** status
  * 6:  means **Canceled** status
* **Can_redeem**: indicates whether the gift card code can be redeem or not.  This is a required information. There are 2 **Can Redeem**’s states:
  * 1: means the gift card code can be redeem
  * 2: means the gift card code can not be redeem
* **Store_id**: corresponding to the Store View ID in ``Stores > Settings> All Stores``. This is a required information.
* **Pool_id**: corresponding to the Gift Card Pools ID in Manage Gift Card Pools. If you leave it blank, that gift card does not belong to any Pools
* **Template_id**: corresponds to the ID of the Gift Card Template contained in Manage Templates. If you leave it blank, Gift Card does not have a template
* **Expired_at**: indicates the expiration date of a gift card. If you leave it blank, the gift card has no expiration (Permanent)

To the next step, we need to choose an Action for Import. In **Import Behaviour**, choose “Add/Update” so that gift code(s) will be automatically added to **Manage Gift Code**
![](https://i.imgur.com/b7917m6.png)

Now you can select a CSV file to import.
* Choose file you want to import.
* The importable CSV file needs to meet the above conditions.
To make sure things will be worked well, click the red ``Check data`` button. Data in the submitted CSV file will be checked and a message will inform whether it's valid or not. In case of being invalid, admins need to check the CSV file (specially required columns, column’s name,etc). With the valid case, the Import button will appear along with the message like below
![](https://i.imgur.com/XbzorBO.png)

Clicking the ``Import`` button is the final steps!
